L'Art de L'Attention, Symbioses is an improvisation device for saxophone and electronics in real time. 
Please refer to the attached score for the performance. 
This device is based on a reinjection matrix, with feedback cascades. 
It is therefore essential to work with someone at the mixing console, 
or to add an audio limiter. Set up for 2d ambisonics, 12 channels.
You'll need a controller with 16 sliders and/or nobs

This Max patch has a presentation mode that can be set-up as a video stage monitor for time synchronisation with the instrumentist.

(If you want to play the set-up with the added video please ask the author of the video : Tania Cortés Becerra https://www.taniacortesbecerra.com/)

Program notes:

« Based on botanical observations, gardening experiments and bioacoustics monitoring carried out in the MSH Paris Nord’s Garden in Motion since November 2020, 
we have led a research-creation process culminating in several restitutions that experiment with the adaptability of a device. 
Based on this process and for the “Journées d’Informatique Musicale 2023”, we proposed an improvisational and visual performance that tests and questions 
different models of symbiosis and their applications. In an open form score we tested an improvisation set-up with real-time processing, 
symbiosis inspired sound spatialization algorithm and nature inspired visual algorithms that invites listening and attention for the living. 
The musical performance is an experience of improvisation between Sebastián Sarasa Molina at the Saxophone, Diane Schuh who composed the score and transforms 
bioacoustics recording and saxophone in real time and Tania Cortés who designed the video and generates the transformations in real time. 
The video is a poetic exploration from the garden to the underground mycorrhizal symbiosis.
The music and the video explore improvisation, the concept of emergence and the compositional form between macro and micro time scales. »
